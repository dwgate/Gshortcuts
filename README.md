# Google Chrome Utility Extensions

## Gshortcuts
Gshortcuts is a utility extension for chrome that alleviates the need for and utilization of the bookmark bar. Chrome's bookmark bar takes up valuable pixels in the browser. Gshortcuts provides access to shortcuts in a convenient location without reducing the size of your window display.

## TabNumbers
You can switch between tabs by pressing cmd/ctrl + [the number of desired tab]. I find that the more tabs open, the longer it takes to figure out the number of the tab I want to switch to. TabNumbers attaches numbers to the tab titles. This makes it instantly apprent which number tab you would like to switch to.
