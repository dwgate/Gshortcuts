# Gshortcuts
Gshortcuts is a utility extension for chrome that alleviates the need for and utilization of the bookmark bar. Chrome's bookmark bar takes up valuable pixels in your browser. Gshortcuts provides access to shortcuts on a convenient location in your browser that won't reduce the size of your browser interface.

## Future Plans
Initially, I only have shortcuts to Google Drive, Google Image Search, and Gmail. I chose these three because I commonly visit these domains and was sick of having to type out the full address to get to these locations, and I did not want to use a bookmark bar for only 3 sites.

I plan to expand this to include an options page where a user can either select from a preset list of shortcuts, or the ability to add their own shortcuts.

## How To
Gshortcuts is not yet on the Google Play store, so if you're interested in using Gshortcuts in the meantime...
